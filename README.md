# Project Overview

This project involved taking a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, and applying a test suite.

As a result, a number of Jasmine tests were completed as required, to ensure this webpage operates correctly.

## Background

The original project files are available from Udacity [Udacity Feedreader Project]  (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

The testing suite used for this project is Jasmine [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io/).  There are some useful documents at that reference that detail the various specific testing functions.

## Installation

Download this repository.  Once complete, open the `index.html` file.  This will display the web-based application.  You will need to scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the results of the Jasmine tests.

## Test Details

2. Ensures that each RSS feed has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
3. Ensures that each RSS feed has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
